In that sense many of the coding problems that accompany this book can be viewed as not really challenging. If, however, you truly want to learn and understand a problem, the best way to do it is to simply code yourself. It is also the most satisfying experience! In the spirit of our book, for each coding problem we try to give you step-by-step guidance and pseudo codes, and include examples of solutions you should expect to see. We hope you will enjoy the experience!* </span>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"steady-bikini","metadata":{"id":"steady-bikini"},"source":["<center>\n","    \n","# Swift-Hohenberg equation in two dimensions\n","\n","</center>    \n","    \n","As we discussed in the SMB section 8.2.2, to develop some intuition for pattern formation in spatially extended systems, we start with the Swift-Hohenberg model equation.
